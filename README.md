Travelling Salesman Problem

Details
* The program should read from stdin and write to stdout.
* It is not required to keep track of the running time of program.

* Input:
# First line will tell you the type(euclidean or non-euclidean)
of the problem and second line will specify the number of
cities in the test case.
# Next n(number of cities) lines will be showing the 2-D
co-ordinates of the cities located in the virtual map.
# Next n lines will specify the distance matrix between cities.Details

* Output:
# You are required to print the space separated indexes of
the cities in single line. Index will start from ONE(1) and
third line will be specifying the co-ordinates of the first
city(index 1).
# Reduce the number of print statements if you want to give
more time to the algorithm to search for better path. If you
get better path than the previous, it is recommended that you
write it to stdout.
# Please flush the stdout periodically, so that the tour gets
written to the stdout before it gets terminated by the
evaluator.
